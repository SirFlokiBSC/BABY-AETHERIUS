# BABY-AETHERIUS
Baby Aetherius is a rewards-based token inspired by the main Aetherius project.  It provides Aetherius rewards to investors by simply holding on to their shares.  Baby Aetherius also has various utilities scheduled on its roadmap.    Among them include the distribution of NFTs of different rarities, a staking platform, and an exciting integration of both usecases to maximize the earnings held by its investors.  Baby Aetherius possesses a safe, profitable and self-sustaining set of tokenomics.  WIth an initial supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, fifty percent of which have been burned at launch, the coin only imposes 10/10 buy/sell taxes.  Of these liens, 3% goes to the purchase of Aetherium rewards to entice investors to stay, 4% goes to marketing to encourage more people to buy, and 3% goes to liquidity to protect the investorsâ€™ money from sudden fluctuations in prices.
